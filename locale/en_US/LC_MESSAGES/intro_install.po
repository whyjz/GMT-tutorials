"`GMT`_ 的全名是 Generic Mapping Tools，顧名思義，它是一套多功能的製圖工具。\\ 這套軟體始於 1988 "
"年，由當時就讀於拉蒙特-杜赫第地球觀測站 (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) 的 Pål (Paul) Wessel "
"和 Walter H. F. Smith 設計製作，並在 1991 年公開發表第一版。[#]_ 此軟體釋出後，即收到廣大迴響，\\ "
"這些稱讚與建議就成了兩位作者 (與其後加入開發團隊的所有人員) 繼續更新的原動力。\\ 二十多個年頭過去了，GMT 目前已經更新到第 5 "
"版，在地理繪圖領域享有一席之地，\\ 更是許多領域，如地球物理學、海洋科學等等，一定會接觸到的軟體之一。"
msgstr ""
"`GMT`_ is the short for Generic Mapping Tools. As the name suggested, it is "
"used for geographical mapping for different purposes. This idea was first "
"initiated in 1988 by Pål (Paul) Wessel and Walter H. F. Smith, who were "
"graduate students at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and the package was "
"first released in 1991. 1 After its release, people soon found how useful "
"and powerful the package could be, and their feedback have become the "
"driving forces of two authors and the whole GMT developing team. 20 years "
"later, GMT has already released its fifth edition, and has taken a major "
"role in geographical mapping. For academic fields like geophysics or "
"oceanography, GMT has become the introductory toolbox for plotting "
"scientific data."

"GMT 身為「通用」的製圖工具，當然可以進行一般性的科學繪圖，大部分你想得到的圖表種類，\\ 都可以利用 GMT "
"內附的指令來完成。但本軟體真正的強大之處，還是在於地理資料的處理與\\ 地圖的繪製。GMT 內建許多和地理資訊系統 (GIS) 有關的演算法，搭配 "
"PostScript 格式的\\ 圖層化向量輸出，讓使用者可以輕鬆的藉由一個個指令，就完成精美且高解析度的地圖。"
msgstr ""
"As “generic” mapping tools, GMT is of course capable for different types of "
"scientific plots. In most cases, GMT’s built-in commands are able to deal "
"with the plot you want. However, what really makes this package so powerful "
"is GMT is very good at processing geographical data and plotting them, "
"thanks to the core algorithms that are bound to the concept of GIS. GMT uses "
"PostScript as the vectorized map output format; a high-resolution, beautiful "
"map only takes you little time with multiple, well-designed console commands."

"如果你有製作地圖的需求，不管是全球地圖還是自家附近的街道圖，都可以考慮使用 GMT。\\ 不過，GMT "
"特別適合用於科學製圖，這是因為指令化的操作方式，讓觀測或實驗數據\\ 變得很容易搭配地理資訊一同呈現。因此，筆者尤其推薦 GMT 給以下兩種人："
msgstr ""
"If you are in need for making some sort of maps, no matter it is global or "
"only around your home, GMT has always been a good choice. Specifically "
"speaking, GMT suits better for scientific mapping because all the data and "
"observations are easily to be processed by various built-in commands, and "
"also they can be shown with other GIS data without any pain. Here I highly "
"recommend GMT for the following kinds of people:"

#: ../../intro_install.rst:30
msgid "**手邊有大量的數據，而且想要跟地圖一起呈現的人。**\\ 例如：降雨量分佈、斷層與地震帶、海底地形圖、全世界火山分佈圖等等。"
msgstr ""
"**If you have tons of data and want to show them on a map**, like "
"precipitation, bathymetry, global volcano distribution, etc."

#: ../../intro_install.rst:33
msgid "**時常繪製地圖，並且總是覺得使用 GIS 軟體效率太低的人。**\\ 學習指令列繪圖的技巧，一定能讓你的 GIS 繪圖效率大增。"
msgstr ""
"**If you make maps pretty often and feel that GIS software has always slowed "
"your working efficiency**. Learning how to plot using command-line tools "
"should improve your work and save your time by a lot."

"唯一的問題是，GMT 所有的功能都必須透過指令列操作，對於沒接觸過指令列程式的人而言，\\ GMT 的上手曲線可能沒那麼平緩。幸好，GMT "
"自身的指令格式並不那麼困難，而且在大多數的\\ 情形下，我們也不需要使用 GMT 以外的指令操作資料，因此只要稍微熟稔一點操作介面的觀念，\\ "
"就可輕鬆上手。有關詳情可以參考「\\ :doc:`basic_concept`\\ 」。"
msgstr ""
"The only trouble to get a swing of GMT is, however, you need to write some "
"command lines to get GMT work. For those who have never used consoles like "
"cmd or linux terminal, a steep learning curve would be expected. "
"Fortunately, the GMT built-in commands are not that hard compared to many "
"other standard console commands, and we only need a little other commands "
"that are not from GMT in many cases. That means as long as we have learned "
"the basic of in command-line interface, we would be ready to master GMT. "
"Please go to :doc:`basic_concept` for more details."

"筆者目前為地球物理與行星科學領域的研究生，前前後後接觸 GMT 也有數年的時間。\\ 有感於網路上缺少 GMT "
"的簡明中文教學資料，導致包括筆者在內的許多人得花額外的時間\\ 熟悉各種工具的用法，因此決定試著紀錄一些使用心得與操作程序，並設計成教學手冊，\\ "
"讓新手們可以由淺入深學習 GMT，老鳥們也可以把本教學當成工具書一般的查看。"
msgstr ""
"I’m currently a graduate student in geophysics and planetary sciences, with "
"several years of GMT experience Since I’m always trying hard to find a good "
"and easy-to-understand GMT tutorials, which sometimes makes me frustrated "
"and spend more time getting familiar with every tools, I decided to write "
"some of my scripts and thoughts down and designed them as a step-by-step "
"tutorials. Beginners should be able to follow the path through every chapter "
"and get more senses gradually. If you’ve already got some tastes before, "
"this tutorials should also work as a reference book and you can always look "
"up for specific questions."

"本教學的難度，是放在讓從沒操作過指令列程式的使用者也能理解的等級，並循序漸進到一些\\ 比較像程式碼的華麗繪圖流程。學習 GMT "
"最佳的方法，除了參考本手冊或其他線上說明外，\\ 實際動手做更是掌握此工具的不二法門，因此在本教學中所有的章節都會提供繪圖資料以供各位\\ "
"使用，或許你可以畫得出比章節的目標更漂亮的地圖！"
msgstr ""
"I try to include every level of difficulty in this tutorials. It starts for "
"a person who has never ever tried command lines, and gradually proceed to "
"some brilliant workflow written as bash scripts. The best way to learn GMT "
"is actually do it yourself rather than any online resources and this "
"tutorials, so all the contents in every chapter are provided, and you can "
"download them for making a map which even surpasses the one in a chapter!"

"目前 GMT 的安裝並不算是太困難，\\ `官網有對應各種平台的安裝教學 (英文) <http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/"
"projects/gmt/wiki/Installing>`_，\\ 而所有可供安裝的檔案則放在\\ `下載頁面 <http://gmt.soest."
"hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Download>`_。\\ 基本上 Windows 選擇 ``.exe`` "
"檔安裝，Linux 則透過 ``yum 伺服器`` 或 ``.tar`` 檔安裝，而 ``.dmg`` 檔則供 Mac "
"使用。值得注意的是，下載頁面中還有兩個檔案，分別叫做 **dcw-gmt** 和 **gshhg-gmt**，內容為一些 常用的地理資料，推薦在 GMT "
"下載安裝前，先把這兩個資料載下來解壓縮，再移到你喜歡的位置存放 (GMT 會詢問使用者\\ 這兩個資料庫的路徑)。dcw 和 gshhg "

"It’s not hard to install GMT. The `official site <http://gmt.soest.hawaii."

"platforms, and the installation packs are on the `Download Page <http://gmt."
"soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Download>`_. Basically, Windows users "

"install GMT via ``yum server`` or ``.tar``. Note that there are two more "
"files on the Download Page: **dcw-gmt** and **gshhg-gmt**. It is highly "
"recommended to download and extract them before installing GMT, as they "
